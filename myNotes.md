# Remarks


## notes:
### 01 - Different regions of data science
- ML: Collection of algorithms. DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT domain knowledge, Data preprocessing 
- Workflow: 
1) Data cleaning, bring  into useful form
2) Domain knowledge used for deciding which
3) ML ALG to use





# TODOs
- Create Lists of Machine Learning Algorithms (Mindmap)
- Containing:
-- problem type to which they are suited (classification or regression)
-- related algorithms, and taxonomic class (decision tree, kernel, etc.).
